//code is here.
// CPP program that just counts and tests limits of the string capacity.  Then shows results
// I have not tested the CATCH  and TRY for error as not hit that error yet. . .

//Purpose:  Test c++ see how large the string can hold before it crashes.  

//System libraries
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
string big,dave,dan;
dave="It is time for all good men";
dan="It is time for all trivial and weak men";
//show strings.   If just doing memory and speed test,  remove. 
//cout<<dan+dave;
//this makes a big string fast and I can't make it overflow, string can be HUGE IT SEEMS.  400 megabytes at least.
try{
for(int i=0;i<=10;i++)
  {
    dave=dan+dave+dave+dave+dave;
    big=dave;
    dave=big+dave;
//    cout<<dave;
    cout<<endl<<"Did the string, did it get bigger?  This is run number "<<i<<".  So the string size now, that fit into memory is: "<<endl;
     
     {
     int count = 0;
     for (char c : dave) {
         count++;
        // cout<<count;

       }
       cout<<count<<endl;
       cout<<endl;

  }
  
//cout<<dave;
